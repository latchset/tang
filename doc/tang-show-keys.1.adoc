== NAME

tang-show-keys - Output signing key thumbprints

== SYNOPSIS

*tang-show-keys* [<PORT>]

== DESCRIPTION

It is sometimes necessary to manually verify that a client has
received the expected Tang advertisement.

The client will usually show the thumbprints of the signing keys in
the advertisement it got, and this tool will show the thumbprints of
the signing keys used by the Tang server on localhost.  If these two
sets of thumbprints agree, the client has the right advertisement and
it is safe to let the client use it.

<PORT> is the port that the Tang server is listening on on localhost.
It defaults to 80.
