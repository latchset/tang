== NAME

tangd-rotate-keys - Perform rotation of tang keys

== SYNOPSIS

*tangd-rotate-keys* [-h] [-v] -d <KEYDIR>

== DESCRIPTION

in order to preserve the security of the system over the long run, you need to periodically
rotate your keys. The precise interval at which you should rotate depends upon your application,
key sizes and institutional policy. For some common recommendations, see: https://www.keylength.com.

*tangd-rotate-keys* generates new keys in the key database directory given by the *-d* option.
This is typically */var/db/tang*. It also rename the old keys to have a leading . in order to
hide them from advertisement.

Tang will immediately pick up all changes. No restart is required.

At this point, new client bindings will pick up the new keys and old clients can continue to
utilize the old keys. Once you are sure that all the old clients have been migrated to use the
new keys, you can remove the old keys. Be aware that removing the old keys while clients are
still using them can result in data loss. You have been warned.

== OPTIONS
*  *-d* <KEYDIR>:
  The directory with the keys, e.g. /var/db/tang

* *-h*:
  Display the usage information

* *-v*:
  Verbose. Display additional info on keys created/rotated
